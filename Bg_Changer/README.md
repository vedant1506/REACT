First of all go and write basic tailwind css classes and then we will use props to counter them

introduce  //const [color, setColor] = useState("olive"); this and it will change color

we have to change color through buttons so we use onclick event with callback function which we will define earlier like here is

//function changeColor(color) {
   setColor(color);
 }

 and then in button onclick things u can select colors


 you can directly use setcolor method so that it u have not to define changecolor variable like this
 // onClick={() => setColor("red")
