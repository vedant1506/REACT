configure tailwindcss with vite with the help of steps markdown into its website.


and intialize this as in a file where u have this card component and it has intialize like {props.attribute} and u have to provide a thing at starting of function if u are using props just go with (props) in the function and there is a second approach like u will see in a code


to use props you have to pass them as attributes to the component. For example, if you have a Card component that takes a username prop, you can use it like this:

<!--<Card username="Vedant" />
<Card username="Divy" />
<Card username="Vishwesh" />-->
